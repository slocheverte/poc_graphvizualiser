    "summary": "The query to find the shortest path between the specified devices returned no nodes or relationships, indicating a potential issue in network visibility or connectivity.",
    "technical_analysis": "The query results indicate that there are no visible paths or connections between the devices w1clictxxa2301.aepc.com and s1clisgbd60434.aepc.com. This could be due to several reasons such as network segmentation, misconfigured network devices, or lack of proper network mapping. The absence of nodes and relationships suggests that either the devices are not connected through the expected network infrastructure or there is an issue with the network data collection process.",
    "recommendations": "1. Verify the network topology and ensure that all network devices and connections are properly documented and monitored. 2. Check for any network segmentation policies that might be preventing visibility between these devices. 3. Ensure that network monitoring tools are correctly configured to capture all relevant network paths and relationships. 4. Conduct a manual network trace or use alternative tools to verify connectivity between the devices.",

    "risk_assessment": "The inability to map network paths poses a medium risk as it may hinder threat detection and response capabilities, potentially allowing undetected lateral movement within the network.",
